# 📘 LearnCpp Practice Repository

Welcome to my **LearnCpp** practice repository!  
This repo contains my notes, exercises, and example programs created while following the curriculum at **[LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/)**.

It serves as:
- A structured learning archive  
- A reference for modern C++ concepts  
- A progression tracker as I build toward advanced C++ (graphics, OpenGL, game dev, etc.)

## 🛠️ Compiling the Code

### Using g++
```bash
g++ -std=c++20 filename.cpp -o program
./program

Using Clang++
clang++ -std=c++20 filename.cpp -o program
./program

Future Support (Planned)

CMake project structure

VS Code tasks.json / launch.json templates

Unit tests for exercises

🚀 Roadmap / Future Enhancements

 Add summaries for each chapter

 Add a CMake build system

 Add unit tests for exercises

 Add automated formatting (clang-format)

 Add example projects using concepts learned
