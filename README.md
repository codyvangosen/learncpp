# learncpp
A structured collection of C++ exercises, notes, and practice code based on the LearnCpp.com curriculum.

LearnCPP Practice Repository

This repository contains my structured learning notes, example programs, and practice exercises based on the curriculum from LearnCpp.com
.
It serves as a personal reference, a progression tracker, and a hands-on space to develop modern C++ skills.

📘 Goals of This Repository

Build a strong foundation in modern C++ (C++17/C++20)

Practice each chapter’s concepts with small, focused programs

Maintain clean, well-commented code suitable for reference

Document learning progress in a clear and organized way

Prepare for more advanced systems, graphics, and game-related C++ work

(You can adjust chapter naming — this is just a clean suggested format.)

🧪 How to Compile the Code

Using g++:

g++ -std=c++20 filename.cpp -o program
./program


Or using VS Code tasks or a CMakeLists file once the repo grows.

📝 Notes

Code examples follow the structure introduced in LearnCpp.

Many examples include extra commentary to reinforce concepts.

This repo is for learning purposes only — not for redistribution of LearnCpp content.

📌 Future Plans

Convert repeated compile workflows into a CMake project

Add unit tests for later chapters

Document insights gained while learning
