# 📘 LearnCpp Practice Repository

Welcome to my **LearnCpp** practice repository!  
This repo contains my notes, exercises, and example programs created while following the curriculum at **[LearnCpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com/)**.

It serves as:
- A structured learning archive  
- A reference for modern C++ concepts  
- A progression tracker as I build toward advanced C++ (graphics, OpenGL, game dev, etc.)

## 🛠️ Compiling the Code

### Using g++
```bash
g++ -std=c++20 filename.cpp -o program
./program

### Using Clang++
clang++ -std=c++20 filename.cpp -o program
./program

Future Support (Planned)
